    "## OSC Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "OSC (Open Sound Control) was originally developed to control sound devices and instruments over network. For example, an application on your tablet can contain the controllers of an audio synthesiser. It basically sends messages with parameters over network from one device/application to another. For example, message to control volume can be like:\n",
    "<br>__/volume 35__ or __/bgm/volum 35__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part __/volume__ is the message path, and the following __35__ is the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>One main advantage of this protocol is its simplicity and ease to add more messages into it. One downside of it is it can't handle large amount of data in its argument (for example sending large size images).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>We will/were use this protocol to communicate Python scripts with other applications (for example, Processing). This session we will use it to communicate with smartphone to receive phone's sensors.\n",

    "## Communicating Smartphone Sensors \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Zig-Project](https://zig-project.com) applications to handle sensor data from the phone. __ZIGSIM__ app sends OSC messages to the PC containing selected sensors from the application.\n",

    "There is also a useful application for PC named __ZIG indicator__ that can visualize the sent information:\n",
